            Dear God. I long for simple hues <br>
            round-about-round me. Deep within wake darkness. <br>
            You told me of your blue. <br>
            I cup my hands. I circle above. <br> 
            Pray. Deliver — on feathered wings. <br>
            What a life brought into view. <br>
            Burning a white, blinding a fire. <br>
            Hands pressed to all what was. <br>
            I bow my head before myself. What have I become? <br>
            Your blue (I drown. I haunt. I feed.) <br>
            Your blue (I grieve. I gasp. I breathe.) <br>
            Your blue (Have I yet learned enough?) <br>
            I mantra: I blue, blue, blue. <br>

            Stepped in her world (In my walk to leave mine’s behind) <br>
            Wished she watched her steps (Her careless meanderings) <br>
            Aimless into roads smash into her (It’s evening rush hour) <br>
            Bones, sinews, & all, spread & splayed (A Jackson Pollack on burning asphalt) <br>
            Her eyes left leered (Permanent) to a fracturing expanse <br>
            Witness to the (Said) cost of freedom <br>
            (Said to) Chart apart from (Animalistic) urges: always charged with (Animalistic) drive <br>
            That is the beginning of stories weaved into our fabric (Turn wine into water) <br>
            Pile civil folds to be dressed (Clothe the absence of friend or foe) <br>
            Cloud the face of judgement to my sin laid bare (To her it is apparent) <br>
            The Predator has run amuck (Five cruel wicked fingers) <br>
            Beat my brow until blue & blamed (As she runs into a mask of green) <br>
            My sole bare shoes hit the empty street (Always be led back )<br>
            A blue tie around my neck (A black jacket straight my chest) <br>
            Back to courses charted amongst filled pews (The word of God reigns) <br>
            They had said she doesn’t have a soul (Yet I do) <br>
            Punish my throat with a burn (Corporal to laugh, to cry, to sing!) <br>
            In a world unraveling at the seam (Her instinct is deep within the trees) <br>
            A solace I fail to find (Fuck absurdist philosophy) <br>
            Stopped short by worldly religion (I find myself with her) <br>
            My eyes peeled back (On she & I) <br>
            My cheeks (Inflamed) pressed on either ethereal gate (Lost sight of childish color) <br>
            I hold in my hands what they say will save me (Bring me back to who I am meant to be) <br>
            And yet still — the Deer runs away with more than I <br>
            Far from human creation <i>Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!</i> (What hands have wrought!) <br>
            How I envy her (Now a lost blur in the green)

            Blissful still, it’s the promise of a good time <br>
            when winds buffet to the tunes of stereo rhymes. <br>
            Laughter collides in backseat where bodies smoosh together <br>
            worries lost to California weather. <br>
            Heat waves beat, trap time in lazy days. <br>
            slipping under to fever daydreams (Black flyaways). <br>
            Blistering heat beads sweat across chafed brows <br>
            Trailing past tan lines, all the way down. <br>
            Glistening half-naked torsos hold onto an arrogant pride <br>
            Glean pleasure aroused (What I wished to call mine). <br>
            Bares its roaring head — without a muzzle — traces <br>
            Muscled grooves & dips to forbidden places. <br>
            Under summer’s smolder is a painted oasis <br>
            lingers such tinted nostalgia (My heart still races). <br>
            An ache rises as sun comes to set. <br>
            Flushed lips against my ear where disbelief is met. <br>
            (The last whisper) The end of such gorgeous summers.

              last night, a man came: through my window <br>
              and fucked me, that i forgot my religion <br>
              that i sit at the backs, of the congregation <br>
              at the backs, of heads: asking if they’d known <br>
              asking if they’d tell; asking if they’d past by what damns me <br>
              given eyes but unlike mine <br> 
              stare at men dreamt women and women dreamt men <br>
              seeking forgiveness for last night <br>
              plead that i have sinned; so i snapped and snipped away <br>
              my head down solemn as i pray <br>
              instead to stare at wandering eyes that met mine <br>
              what remains of this freedom fractured<br>
              that if i cannot fly, can cry; grieve over splintered wings <br>
              left divots — blood cross guilty hands <br>

              I learned to knit from men on Youtube, I used two needles & a ball of yarn. Hands guided by instinct: Into a loop, 
              stitching (What Mother calls) unnatural. Because she forgets us — men. That first created clothes: to make our bare 
              bodies beautiful. Proud membership in a guild of prestigious crafting: ribbed stockings, sweater vests. (Their 
              distaste) Lips pouted I imagine at the mistakes I leave behind: Holes. I finger the roundabout, tracing the gaping 
              border if it then would close in on itself. My hands in mindless repetition. Left at the pew to witness words, lashing 
              down from the pulpit: 
              
              <br>
              
              <div style="text-align:center;">
              “Agape for souls, souls bound by love eternal. <br>
              Philia for hands, hands held together. <br>
              Eros for hearts, hearts lost to forever end.” 
              </div>

              <br>
              
              I chased after my Mother’s heart, silent as it broke clean. Did time exist when 
              her eyes shut to sleep instead to drip in incessant prayer? I swore penance with skin flaps I’d carve out. Like white 
              flags surrendering in insistence that I committed. My holey clothes laid shame, strewn. I step in whole, cocooned in 
              naval string. To cleanse, to clean, to rebirth: an empty cavity (My hands & soul have lost a brother). Cheeks marred 
              in streaks of a warrior, stabbing due violence into blood-caked clothes (I once knit). On scrapped knees — shrieking, 
              sobbing: <i>It is finished. It is finished.</i>
