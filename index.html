            Cramped to fill a body with such hope to the brim. Conscripted bodies contract in and out — the empty bellies of the ship. Breath in soon the fertile land to harvest American Dreams! Breathe out far away the ache for the motherland! To one day willing return.

            Degrees in hand: a bachelor’s and a master’s. Stamped for “exceptional merit”, for an “exceptional worker”, for an “exceptional immigrant” to fly over the Atlantic, over the island of captive angels staring — eyes landing on the New York harbor.

            Late, the bulb flashed — on white faces blinding. Before your sweat, your blood could crust, on railroads built, on the bodies it buried.

            Verse 18 as to be foreign, is to be astray. But with faith, brothers & sisters filled the pews. All from the homeland as this land has past seen. To endow by the Creator these unalienable rights. As in this church, it means to pray: Green cards, Green bills, heads down, on stilts.

            Jagged, the glass shards which emptied savings of a life’s worth. Of non-perishable spirits until they shattered in a riot. The grief that tumbled down dusted shelves, coalesced & chanted, a shared rage downtown Los Angeles streets. Built to scrape, goad the other apart.

            Wished she watched her steps (Her careless meanderings) <br>
            Aimless into roads smash into her (It’s evening rush hour) <br>
            Bones, sinews, & all, spread & splayed (A Jackson Pollack on burning asphalt) <br>
            Her eyes left leered (Permanent) to a fracturing expanse <br>
            Witness to the (Said) cost of freedom <br>
            (Said to) Chart apart from (Animalistic) urges: always charged with (Animalistic) drive <br>
            That is the beginning of stories weaved into our fabric (Turn wine into water) <br>
            Pile civil folds to be dressed (Clothe the absence of friend or foe) <br>
            Cloud the face of judgement to my sin laid bare (To her it is apparent) <br>
            The Predator has run amuck (Five cruel wicked fingers) <br>
            Beat my brow until blue & blamed (As she runs into a mask of green) <br>
            My sole bare shoes hit the empty street (Always be led back )<br>
            A blue tie around my neck (A black jacket straight my chest) <br>
            Back to courses charted amongst filled pews (The word of God reigns) <br>
            They had said she doesn’t have a soul (Yet I do) <br>
            Punish my throat with a burn (Corporal to laugh, to cry, to sing!) <br>
            In a world unraveling at the seam (Her instinct is deep within the trees) <br>
            A solace I fail to find (Fuck absurdist philosophy) <br>
            Stopped short by worldly religion (I find myself with her) <br>
            My eyes peeled back (On she & I) <br>
            My cheeks (Inflamed) pressed on either ethereal gate (Lost sight of childish color) <br>
            I hold in my hands what they say will save me (Bring me back to who I am meant to be) <br>
            And yet still — the Deer runs away with more than I <br>
            Far from human creation <i>Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!</i> (What hands have wrought!) <br>
            How I envy her (Now a lost blur in the green)

            Flushed lips against my ear where disbelief is met. <br>

              plead that i have sinned; so i snapped and snipped away <br>
              my head down solemn as i pray <br>
              instead to stare at wandering eyes that met mine <br>
              what remains of this freedom fractured<br>
              that if i cannot fly, can cry; grieve over splintered wings <br>

              <p>
              I learned to knit from men on Youtube, I used two needles & a ball of yarn. Hands guided by instinct: Into a loop, 
              stitching (What Mother calls) unnatural. Because she forgets us — men. That first created clothes: to make our bare 
              bodies beautiful. Proud membership in a guild of prestigious crafting: ribbed stockings, sweater vests. (Their 
              distaste) Lips pouted I imagine at the mistakes I leave behind: Holes. I finger the roundabout, tracing the gaping 
              border if it then would close in on itself. My hands in mindless repetition. Left at the pew to witness words, lashing 
              down from the pulpit: 
              
              <br>
              
              <div style="text-align:center;">
              “Agape for souls, souls bound by love eternal. <br>
              Philia for hands, hands held together. <br>
              Eros for hearts, hearts lost to forever end.” 
              </div>

              <br>
              
              I chased after my Mother’s heart, silent as it broke clean. Did time exist when 
              her eyes shut to sleep instead to drip in incessant prayer? I swore penance with skin flaps I’d carve out. Like white 
              flags surrendering in insistence that I committed. My holey clothes laid shame, strewn. I step in whole, cocooned in 
              naval string. To cleanse, to clean, to rebirth: an empty cavity (My hands & soul have lost a brother). Cheeks marred 
              in streaks of a warrior, stabbing due violence into blood-caked clothes (I once knit). On scrapped knees — shrieking, 
              sobbing: 
              
              <br>
